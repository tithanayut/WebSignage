# WebSignage
*A [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/) Final Project by Thanayut T.*

WebSignage is a web application that allows companies and organizations to display a collection of banners, ads, or slides on a web browser.

WebSignage is a web application. Therefore, it is able to access from any device that supports web technology. For example, it can be run on a computer, laptop, or single board-computer such as [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)

The design of WebSignage is very simple. Users should be able to understand how to use it in just a few minutes. In short, in order to display signage, a user should: create an account, create new signage, add slides, and click display. Done!
