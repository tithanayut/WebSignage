WebSignage is a web application that allows companies and organizations to display a collection of banners, ads, or slides on a web browser.

WebSignage is a web application. Therefore, it is able to access from any device that supports web technology. For example, it can be run on a computer, laptop, or single board-computer such as [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/).

The design of WebSignage is very simple. In short, in order to display signage, the steps are as follows: register an account, create new signage, add slides, and click display. Done! You can watch these steps at [https://youtu.be/YjM8lggYFBM](https://youtu.be/YjM8lggYFBM).
